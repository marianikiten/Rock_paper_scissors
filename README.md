 Here's my great creation for you, my friends, to enjoy! 
I hope you will love playing my game, and some day I will be able to upload something to Steam, although Sataporn says game-devs don't really make much,
 but still it would be cool if I could.
Personally for Chase: my dear Teacher! no, I should say My dear Master! Don't you be upset I didn't make something similar to what Sataporn will present. Some day I will.
 But for now I beg your apology, I have to ....really, I must go sleep. That's what will help me keep on with this uneasy journey.


Respect to all who's made youtube back in the day, god bless them.
